# react-bmi_calculator
A quick React BMI calculator app.

The calculator updates the BMI in real-time.

Waits for the user to input valid values before calculating.

Made as a part of a JavaScript(+React) course at Tampere University of Applied Sciences.

We quickly skimmed over React on the later half of the course, but we'll go deeper into React on a later course.
